Install docker-compose
Create simple environment with docker-compose
The environment should include the following services:
• MySQL
• Wordpress1
• Wordpress2
• Nginx
• phpMyAdmin
• Redis*

Service names and images in docker- -
compose.yml
pro-mysql (mysql:5.7)
• pro-wp1 (wordpress:5.7-fpm-alpine)
• pro-wp2 (wordpress:5.7-fpm-alpine)
• pro-nginx (nginx:1.15.12-alpine)
• pro-phpmyadmin (phpMyAdmin:latest)
• pro-redis (redis:latest)*

Additional requirements
• MySQL data must be mapped to local directory (./mysql)
• Wordpress data must be mapped to local directory (./wp1 and ./wp2)
• Nginx folder with config files must be mapped to local directory (./nginx)
• The tasks not marked with * are required. You can do the task with * only if
you done all other tasks. Installing REDIS alone is not enough. You need to
configure it to be used in two wordpress services. To do this, you may need to
recreate the standard docker image or create a bash script for deployment.
• Ultimately, you should have two different wordpress sites (wp1.corp.com and
wp2.corp.com). These two sites must use the same database. phpMyAdmin
should be available at db.corp.com
